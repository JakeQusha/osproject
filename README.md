## Desc
 Simulation of scheduling and paging algorithms, written in c++23 for `operating system` laboratories at my university. I use static polymorphism and lot's of modern cpp features just to make my life harder.

## Building and running 
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
